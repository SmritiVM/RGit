### TODOs
1. Jumpto

 1.1 Modify jumpto function to check for staged, shouldn't be able to jump if there are uncommited changes

 1.2 Restore index to previous state

 1.3 Try and utilize the index.rs functions somehow - refactor code in such a way

2. Colour colour for logs

3. Git status (maybe ??)
